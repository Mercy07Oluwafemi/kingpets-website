<h3 class="dotted">Lahsa Apso</h3>
 About<br>
<p>The dignified Lhasa Apso may be the perfect lap dog today, but they once marched the halls of palaces and holy places, keeping watch over what happened inside. Lhasas fondly recall how they were respected and adored—they’re named for the most sacred city in Tibet, after all. So, naturally, they expect that level of respect from their present-day admirers. But their demands aren’t many, just a few treats now and then, a cozy lap to curl up in and their favorite person at their beck and call. It’s a rough job being adorable, but Lhasas are more than happy to fulfill the role.</p><br>
Lhasa Apsos are best for individuals or families with older kids, and they are ideal for people who live in apartments. They don't need a lot of space or exercise, but they do need someone who will be with them for most of the day. While they are strong-willed and need lots of training, a first-time pup parent can do well with a Lhasa if they are committed to the training. <br>
